# Improved Comment Reply Notification
#### a WordPress plugin

This plugin is based on the original [Comment Reply Notification](https://www.nosegraze.com/comment-interaction/) plugin and the modified code from [Nose Graze](https://www.nosegraze.com/comment-interaction/). Now your readers will get a nice email when you (or anyone else) responds to their comments!

**Current functionalities:**

- Works with latest version of WordPress (4.4.2) and PHP 7
- Adds checkbox to comment form to allow users to *opt-out* of comment reply notification emails
- Checks if comment is approved and if comment response is by a different user before sending out notification email
- Sends a customized email using built in wp_mail (customization needs to be done in gp-comment-reply.php)

**To-do list:**

- Add a settings page!
